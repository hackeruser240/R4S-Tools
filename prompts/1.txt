i have been trying yo upload my flask project on my website.
i have uploaded the files to /home/rank4sure/aio in my cpanel. the folder contains app.py which is the entry point of the application.
now i want to setup the python app in cpanel.
there are the following options:

1. Application root
2. Application URL
3. Application startup file
4. Application Entry point

i am attaching app.py

what you need to do:

1. check if the app.py is correctly setup to run and make the website live.
2. give me the values of the above four options that need to be configured in cpanel
